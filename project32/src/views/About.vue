In September of 1992, Pastors Rudy and Juanita Rasmus founded the Bread of Life, Inc. with a simple mission to serve hot nutritious meals to homeless men and women in the downtown Houston area.

By December of 1992, Bread of Life, Inc. was serving more than 500 hot meals per day in the sanctuary of St. John’s Downtown Church. It wasn’t long before Bread of Life, Inc. became a fixture in the downtown area providing much needed services, resources and support to families in need and the homeless population.

Nearly 30 years later, Bread of Life, Inc. is still focused on supporting underserved communities and restoring hope in Houston through its four program areas: Homeless Outreach, Health Outcomes, Hunger Relief, and community radio station KMAZ The Amazing 102.5 FM. Through your generous donations and support, Bread of Life, Inc. continues to help create an improved quality of life for the people of Houston.
